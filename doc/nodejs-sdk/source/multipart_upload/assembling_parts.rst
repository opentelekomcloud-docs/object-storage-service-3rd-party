Assembling Parts
================

Function
--------

This API assembles the uploaded parts to complete the multipart upload. Before performing this operation, you cannot download the uploaded data. When assembling parts, you need to copy the additional message header information recorded during the multipart upload initiation to the object metadata. Such information is processed in the same way the information in a regular object upload is processed. In the case of assembling parts concurrently, the Last Write Wins strategy applies, but the time of Last Write is defined as the time when a multipart upload was initiated.

As long as the multipart upload is not aborted, all uploaded parts occupy the space. However, after you assembled the specified parts, those uploaded but not assembled will be deleted to free up space.

When assembling parts, OBS arranges parts in ascending order by part number. If any object metadata is provided during the initiation of the multipart upload, OBS will associate this metadata with the object. When the multipart upload is complete, the individual parts will no longer exist. A part assembling request must contain the upload ID, part numbers, and ETag values. OBS responses include the ETag that uniquely identifies the object data. This ETag is not required to be the MD5 hash value of the object data.

Restrictions
------------

-  To assemble parts, you must be the bucket owner or have the required permission (**obs:object:PutObject** in IAM or **PutObject** in a bucket policy).
-  After a multipart upload is complete, the uploaded parts that were not assembled will be automatically deleted and cannot be restored. Before assembling parts, use the API for listing uploaded parts to check all parts to ensure no parts were left out.
-  If the size of any part other than the last part is smaller than 100 KB, OBS returns **400 Bad Request**.

The ETag is a unique identifier for the object's contents, used to determine if the object has been updated. For example, if the ETag value is **A** when an object is uploaded and becomes **B** when the object is downloaded, this indicates the contents of the object were changed. The ETag reflects changes of an object, not of the metadata. Objects created by the upload and copy operations have unique ETags after being encrypted using MD5. |
