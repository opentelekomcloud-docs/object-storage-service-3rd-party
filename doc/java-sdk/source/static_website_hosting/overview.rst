Overview
========

To host your static website on OBS, you can upload static website files to your bucket as objects, configure the public read permission for the objects, and then configure static website hosting for your bucket.

After this, when third-party users access your websites, they actually access the objects in your bucket in OBS.

When using static website hosting, you can configure request redirection to redirect specific or all requests.

For more information about the application scenarios of static website hosting, see:
