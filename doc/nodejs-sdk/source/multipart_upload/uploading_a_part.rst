Uploading a Part
================

Function
--------

After a multipart upload is initiated, this API uploads a part to a specified bucket. In the upload request, the multipart upload ID must be included.

When uploading a part, you must specify its upload ID and part number. You can select any part number between **1** and **10000**. A part number uniquely identifies a part and its location in the object you are uploading. If the number of an uploaded part is used to upload a new part, the uploaded part will be overwritten. Whenever you upload a part, OBS returns the ETag header in the response. For each part upload, you must record the part number and the ETag value. These values are required in subsequent requests to complete a multipart upload.

Restrictions
------------

-  To assemble parts, you must be the bucket owner or have the required permission (**obs:object:PutObject** in IAM or **PutObject** in a bucket policy).
-  Except for the last part uploaded, the other parts range from 0 to 5 GB, and the last part ranges from 100 KB to 5 GB. Part sizes will not be verified during upload because whether an uploaded part is the last one cannot be determined. Their sizes will be verified when being assembled.
-  Each part is numbered from 1 to 10000.
-  The minimum part size supported by an OBS 3.0 bucket is 100 KB, and that supported by an OBS 2.0 bucket is 5 MB. You are advised to perform the multipart upload on OBS 3.0 buckets.

The ETag is a unique identifier for the object's contents, used to determine if the object has been updated. For example, if the ETag value is **A** when an object is uploaded and becomes **B** when the object is downloaded, this indicates the contents of the object were changed. The ETag reflects changes of an object, not of the metadata. Objects created by the upload and copy operations have unique ETags after being encrypted using MD5. |
