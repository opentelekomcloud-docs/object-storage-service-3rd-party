Obtaining Endpoints
===================

-  You can click `here <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/endpoint/index.html>`__ to view the endpoints and regions enabled for OBS.

.. important::

   The SDK allows you to pass endpoints with or without the protocol name. Suppose the endpoint you obtained is **your-endpoint**. The endpoint passed when initializing an instance of **ObsClient** can be **http://your-endpoint**, **https://your-endpoint**, or **your-endpoint**.
