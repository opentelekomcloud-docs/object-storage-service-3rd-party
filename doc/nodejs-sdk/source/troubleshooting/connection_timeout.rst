Connection Timeout
==================

**Problem**: If a "connect ETIMEDOUT" error occurred when calling an API, the possible cause was that the service address (endpoint) was incorrect or the network was disconnected.

**Solution:**

#. Check whether the service address was left blank or invalid.
#. Check the network connection.
#. Check whether the server had returned any exceptions and if so, contact the server-side O&M team.
