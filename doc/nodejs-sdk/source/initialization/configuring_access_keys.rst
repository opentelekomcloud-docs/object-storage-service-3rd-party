Configuring Access Keys
=======================

To use OBS, you need a valid pair of AK and SK for signature authentication.

After obtaining the AK and SK, you can create an instance of ObsClient to call SDK APIs.

For details, see :ref:`Creating Access Keys <obs_29_0103>`.

After obtaining the AK and SK, you can follow these steps to start initialization:

-  :ref:`Configuring an Instance of ObsClient <obs_29_0203>`
