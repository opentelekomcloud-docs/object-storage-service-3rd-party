Missing Modules
===============

**Problem**: When OBS Node.js SDK is used for secondary development, an error message was displayed indicating that a module was missing, for example, "Cannot find module 'xml2js'".

**Solution:**

#. Check whether the version of the local Node.js SDK is the latest.
#. Ensure that the dependency libraries have been correctly installed. For details, see :ref:`Installing the SDK <obs_29_0105>`.
