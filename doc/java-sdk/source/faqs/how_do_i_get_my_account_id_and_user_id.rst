How Do I Get My Account ID and User ID?
=======================================

Obtaining the Account ID and User ID
------------------------------------

When calling APIs, you may need to specify the account ID (**DomainID**) and user ID (**UserID**) in some requests. You need to obtain them from the console in advance. To obtain them from the console, do as follows:

#. Log in to the management console.

#. Hover the mouse pointer over the username and choose **My Credentials** from the drop-down list.

   On the **My Credentials** page, view the account ID and user ID.
