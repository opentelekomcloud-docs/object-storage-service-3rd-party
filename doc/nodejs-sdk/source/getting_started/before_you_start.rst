Before You Start
================

-  Ensure that you are familiar with OBS basic concepts from `Help Center <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/en-us/usermanual/obs/en-us_topic_0045853692.html>`__, such as bucket, object, region, and AK and SK.
-  You can see :ref:`General Ways to Use ObsClient <obs_29_0113>` to learn how to call OBS Node.js SDK APIs in a general manner.
-  **ObsClient** supports API calling results returned via a callback function or the **Promise** object.
-  Some features are available only in some regions. If an API call returns the 405 HTTP status code, check whether the region supports this feature.
