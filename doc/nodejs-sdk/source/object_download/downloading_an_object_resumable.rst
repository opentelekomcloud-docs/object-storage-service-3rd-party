Downloading an Object - Resumable
=================================

Function
--------

The API for resumable download is an encapsulated and enhanced version of range-based download. Downloading large files often fails due to an unstable network or program breakdown. It is a waste of resources to restart the download process upon a download failure, and the restarted download process may still suffer from the unstable network. To resolve such issues, you can use the API for resumable download, whose working principle is to divide the to-be-downloaded file into multiple parts and download them separately. The download result of each part is recorded in a checkpoint file in real time. Only when all parts are successfully downloaded, the result indicating a successful download will be returned. Otherwise, an error is returned in callback function to remind you of calling the API again for re-downloading. Based on the download status of each part recorded in the checkpoint file, the re-downloading will download the parts failed to be downloaded previously, instead of downloading all parts. By virtue of this, resources are saved and efficiency is improved.

By resuming a failed download from where it failed, this API helps save resources. In addition, parts can be downloaded concurrently, which helps speed up the download. During the download process, you do not need to take care of internal service details, such as the creation and deletion of checkpoint files, division of objects, or concurrent downloads of parts.

Restrictions
------------

-  To download an object, you must be the bucket owner or have the required permission (**obs:object:GetObject** in IAM or **GetObject** in a bucket policy).
-  Objects in the Cold storage class can be downloaded only when they are in the **Restored** status.

Code Examples

::

   // Import the OBS library.
   // Use npm to install the client.

   // var ObsClient = require('./lib/obs');

     // Obtain an AK/SK pair on the management console.
