Uploading an Object - Resumable
===============================

Function
--------

The resumable upload is an encapsulated and enhanced version of :ref:`the multipart upload <obs_29_1901>` used for dealing with possible upload failures of large files when the network connection is unstable or a program crashes.

Uploading large files often fails due to poor network conditions or program breakdowns. It is a waste of resources to restart the upload process upon an upload failure, and the restarted upload process may still suffer from the unstable network. To resolve such issues, you can use the API for resumable upload, whose working principle is to divide the to-be-uploaded file into multiple parts and upload them separately. The upload result of each part is recorded in a checkpoint file in real time. Only when all parts are successfully uploaded, the result indicating a successful upload will be returned. Otherwise, an error is returned in callback function to remind you of calling the API again for re-uploading. Based on the upload status of each part recorded in the checkpoint file, the re-uploading will upload the parts failed to be uploaded previously, instead of uploading all parts. By virtue of this, resources are saved and efficiency is improved.

The resumable upload interface helps save resources and improve efficiency by restarting an upload from the point of failure and concurrently uploading parts. You do not need to worry about internal service details, such as the creation and deletion of checkpoint files, division of objects, or concurrent uploads of parts.

Restrictions
------------

The total size of files uploaded by the resumable upload API must be larger than 100 KB.

If user A sets the **bucket-owner-full-control** policy for object **x**, user B then has the control over object **x**. |

The ETag is a unique identifier for the object's contents, used to determine if the object has been updated. For example, if the ETag value is **A** when an object is uploaded and **B** when the object is downloaded, this indicates the contents of the object have been changed. The ETag reflects changes to an object's contents, not its metadata. Objects created by the upload and copy operations have unique ETags after being encrypted using MD5. |

Code Examples
-------------

This example uploads **example/objectname** to **examplebucket** using resumable upload.

::

   // Import the OBS library.
   // Use npm to install the client.
   const ObsClient = require("esdk-obs-nodejs");
   // Use the source code to install the client.
   // var ObsClient = require('./lib/obs');

   // Create an instance of ObsClient.
   const obsClient = new ObsClient({
     // Obtain an AK/SK pair using environment variables or import an AK/SK pair in other ways. Using hard coding may result in leakage.
     // Obtain an AK/SK pair on the management console.
     access_key_id: process.env.ACCESS_KEY_ID,
     secret_access_key: process.env.SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
     // (Optional) If you use a temporary AK/SK pair and a security token to access OBS, you are advised not to use hard coding, which may result in information leakage. You can obtain an AK/SK pair using environment variables or import an AK/SK pair in other ways.
     // security_token: process.env.SECURITY_TOKEN,
     // Enter the endpoint of the region where the bucket is located.
     server: "https://your-endpoint"
   });

   async function uploadFile() {
     try {
       const params = {
         // Specify the bucket name.
         Bucket: 'examplebucket',
         // Specify the object to be created (example/objectname in this example).
         Key: 'example/objectname',
         //Specify the local file to upload (/tmp/objectname in this example).
