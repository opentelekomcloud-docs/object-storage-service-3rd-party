Overview
========

OBS allows you to configure access logging for buckets. After the configuration, access to buckets will be recorded in logs. These logs will be saved in specific buckets in OBS.

You can enable OBS logging for bucket analysis or audit purposes. With access logs, a bucket owner can analyze the characteristics, types, or trends of requests sent to the bucket.

With logging enabled, OBS automatically logs access requests for the bucket and writes the generated log files into a specified bucket.

You need to specify a bucket for storing log files when enabling logging for a bucket. Log files can be stored in any bucket you own in the region where the logged bucket is, including the logged bucket itself.
