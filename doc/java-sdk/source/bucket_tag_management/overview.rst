Overview
========

Tags are used to identify and classify OBS buckets.

If you add tags to a bucket, SDRs generated for the requests sent to this bucket will include these tags, so you can use the tags to classify SDRs for detailed cost analysis.

For example, if you have an application that uploads its running data to a bucket, you can tag the bucket with the application name.

In this manner, the costs of the application can be analyzed using tags in SDRs.

For details about the application scenarios of bucket tags, see:
